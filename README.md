# what-to-watch: Movie Recommendations Project

In this project we created both a collaborative and a content based recommendation system.

We used Kaggle and OMDB for data, and used Python, Pandas, machine learning with Scikit-learn, HTML5, JavaScript, CSS, a little D3.js, and jQuery.

The content-based system worked by comparing the movie the user entered with a number of features of the movie, such as director, actors, genre, etc. And then showing the movies that have the most similarities among the compared features.

The collaborative-based system worked by comparing a userâ€™s profile of liked movies to other users with similar likes, and then providing a list of recommendations based on the similarities found. When using this enter a number, and you can see what movies that user would like.
